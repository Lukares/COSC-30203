The main.s source code comes with a Makefile packaged within this folder.
Type 'make' to generate the main executable and start with ./main. 

make

The above will begin the program after being compiled through gcc. 

This program plays some simple Connect 4. If you follow the prompted input,
you should enjoy some fun Connect 4; however, if you really wanted to, you
could break the shit out of this program and I honestly didn't really have
the patience to handle all ignorant input so take those point from me mate. 

Known issues include:

	- Program shits itself if your name is longer than 16 characters.
	- Program shits itself if you input a negative number or a string
	  instead of the appropriate column number. 
	- One time I played and the computer player won and he never had four
	  in a row. I was only able to see this once and couldn't reproduce
	  it so if you lose to some bullshit well... that sucks I guess you're
	  a loser. 
	- It is not intentional, but you can actually "queue" your moves
	  while the computer player is selecting its column by spamming
	  stdin. This has yet to break the program but like... don't 
	  be an ass, let the computer guy take his time. 
	- Program does not close if all the spaces are full just run a
	  ctrl-Z then kill %1 and startover like a gentlemen. 
	- Player is always X and computer is always O despite lab specification
	  requesting first turn is X and second to go is O. 
	- During the computer turn it does not tell you visually where it will
	  place its computer token. It just... does. We'll call this a feature. 

If you read this README then I salute you with 20+ students to grade why
the hell would you take valuable grading time to read my textualized pain.
But nevertheless, thank you sir. You requested a README, you got one.
